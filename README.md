Narrative Report on the Implementation of the Book Class

Prepared by:Cherry ann Javier, Jomarie Dangaran

As part of the Object-Oriented Programming course, this report documents the activity of implementing the `Book` class in PHP. The task was designed to strengthen understanding of OOP principles by applying theoretical concepts to a practical programming challenge.

Introduction

The activity focused on developing a PHP class named `Book`, encapsulating attributes, and implementing methods to simulate a real-world scenario. By completing this exercise, students were expected to enhance their understanding of creating reusable and modular code using OOP principles. This report outlines the steps taken during the implementation, the challenges faced, and the key learnings from the process.  

Body of the Report

Objective of the Activity 

The primary goal of this task was to demonstrate proficiency in:

1. Defining a class with attributes and methods.

2. Creating and using objects derived from the class.

3. Implementing methods to display data and modify object attributes dynamically.

Implementation Process

1. Class Definition 

   The `Book` class was defined with the following attributes:  

   - `title` (string):Represents the book's name.  

   - `author` (string): Indicates the author of the book.  

   -`price` (float): Represents the cost of the book.  

   - `publication_year` (integer): Stores the book's year of publication.  


   Two methods were implemented:  

   -`displayDetails()`: Prints all book details.  

   - `applyDiscount($percentage)`: Adjusts the price of the book based on a given discount percentage.  

2.Object Creation  

   An object named `myBook` was instantiated and initialized with details of the book, The Great Gatsby, authored by F. Scott Fitzgerald, priced at $15.99, and published in 1925.

3. Application of Methods 

   - Initially, `displayDetails()` was used to show the book's original details.  

   - A 10% discount was then applied using `applyDiscount(10)`.  

   - Finally, `displayDetails()` was called again to display the updated price.  

Results

The program successfully displayed the original and updated details of the book. The correct application of the discount method demonstrated an understanding of encapsulation and the dynamic behavior of objects.

Conclusion 

This activity allowed me to apply OOP concepts in a practical setting, reinforcing my understanding of how classes and objects interact in a programming environment. By implementing the `Book` class, I learned how to structure code for reusability and maintainability while solving real-world problems.  
Through this hands-on exercise, I gained confidence in using PHP for object-oriented programming, which will undoubtedly benefit future projects and real-world applications.
